# Beam Analysis Engine Source Code

* `synthesize_report.py` has a script that allows you to produce a .tex file given a dictionary of Comet IDS.
* `metrics.py` has all the functions that allow you to compute the various metrics we wish to track
* `metric_utils` has a few helper functions that are used when computing some of the metrics in `metrics.py`.
* `plot_utils.py` has some the functions we use to produce nice looking, consistent plots.
* `create_metrics.py` and `returns_analysis` are *old* and needs to be deprecated.
